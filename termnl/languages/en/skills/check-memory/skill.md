## When it's fine

- You're using {@sys.memory.used} of {@sys.memory.total}. Plenty left.
- {@sys.memory.percent} of the memory is in use: that's fine.
- Don't worry {user}: you're using {@sys.memory.used} of {@sys.memory.total}. Plenty left.

## When it's high

- Memory is getting full: {@sys.memory.used} of {@sys.memory.total} in use. Closing a program or two would help.
- {@sys.memory.percent} of the memory is in use. It still works, but it's getting tight.

## When it's full

- Memory is almost full: only {@sys.memory.free} left. Things may slow down; close a program you don't need.
