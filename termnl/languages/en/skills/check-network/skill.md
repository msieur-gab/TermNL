## Command

ip -4 -brief addr

## When it's connected

- You're connected through {@sys.network.through}. Your address on this network is {@sys.network.address}. I only look at the board itself, so I can't tell whether the internet answers.
- Connected through {@sys.network.through}, at {@sys.network.address}. (I don't contact anything outside to check the internet.)

## When it's not connected

- You're not connected to any network: no Wi-Fi and no cable has an address.
