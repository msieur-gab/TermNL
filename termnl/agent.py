"""The dialogue, written as one turn in five steps (since 22 Oct 2026; the version before it, back_agent.py,
was retired on 25 Oct 2026 and stays in git's history).

Every request ends in one of four outcomes:
  act      understood, everything known, nothing to approve: the command is ready to run
  ask      a value is missing or isn't on the device, or the request isn't surely understood:
           a question, with chips when there are choices
  approve  the action is destructive or needs admin rights: the person approves first
  abstain  nothing understood, or the settings don't allow it: the agent says so

One turn (respond):
  1. clean       fillers off ("please", "can you"…)
  2. answer      a question is waiting: yes, no, one of its chips, or a value for "Which one?"
  3. understand  a skill's template reads the sentence exactly; else the model recognises its action
                 and object; a typo is read as a known word, and a word in its context ("turn on the
                 music" plays it), when that reads better; when the model doubts a template, or an
                 action comes without its object ("turn off"), the person chooses; a sentence that says
                 part of a request ("now delete it", "and in downloads?") is completed by the last
                 request done, its frame (follow_up)
  4. safety      not sure, a typo in a change, "don't…": ask before anything
  5. next_step   the next value to ask, a file to find, the settings, the approval; or act

The agent never runs anything and never writes a command: it fills in the command a skill declares,
with every value quoted. Running it is the device's job (runner.py)."""
