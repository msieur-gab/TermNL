"""Reads skill files and the shared lists, and checks them. A skill is one action + object pair:

  ---
  does: create file
  admin: no          needs admin rights (only runs with admin mode on, after approval)
  approve: no        always asks for approval first (destructive, or cuts a connection)
  moves: place       after it runs, you are in that folder (open folder)
  reads: memory      a skill that only reads: the device reads itself (readers.py), no command;
                     or a reader of its command's output (reads: wifi, with iw in ## Command)
  ---
  ## People say     plain sentences (plain.py): a word for the action or object stands for all its
                     words, a/b one of these words, ( ) may be left out, {value} a value
  ## Sentences       or, the older form: templates (template.py), each in `backticks` so <action> and
                     <object> show as written on GitHub instead of vanishing as HTML tags
  ## Also said       how people say it, in plain sentences: for training only, never a rule (Gab's
                     log, 23 Oct: "what is consuming my ram", "chip temperature")
  ## What it needs  - {place}: a folder on the device. If it's not said: where you are. (words/values.md)
  ## Values          or, the older form: - name: kind[, required][, new][, default: x]
                       new: must not exist yet in the place (create file); default: here = where you are
                       @sys.file: a file that must exist, found in the place or anywhere in home
  ## Command         one line; {value} is filled in and quoted
  ## Replies         - key: variant | variant
  ## When it's high  (a reading skill) one reply per line, for when the reader says "high"; the
                     reader's values are written {@sys.memory.used}, the person's name {user}

Kinds: text, secret, a shared list (filetype), or a device list (@sys.folder, @sys.service,
@sys.network, @sys.app, @sys.music, @sys.host)."""
