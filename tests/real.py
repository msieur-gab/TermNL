"""python3 -m tests.real [-v] [--add] — the conversations people really had, against today's TermNL.

tests/real.md holds them (kept out of git, like logs/): each turn, what was typed, what TermNL did
then, and what it should do. "should (Claude):" is Claude's guess, for the person to confirm (remove
"(Claude)") or correct; "should:" alone is theirs.

    --add   adds the conversations in logs/ that real.md doesn't have yet, without a "should"
    -v      every turn, not only those that differ

How "should" is written: the outcome (act, ask, approve, abstain), then the skill if it matters, then
words in quotes that the command, or else the reply, must hold: act create-folder "Pictures".

The replay runs every conversation in order, in one throwaway home that starts as real.md's "Home at
the start" says. Only what can't harm runs there (making, renaming and listing files and folders, and
reading the device); opening, closing, restarting and switching things are simulated."""
