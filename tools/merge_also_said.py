"""python3 -m tools.merge_also_said data/<file>.md [--dry] — adds proposed "Also said" sentences (a `## <skill>`
section per skill, `## none` for out-of-scope) to the skill files, after checking each one:

  dropped  the same words as a sentence of a test set (training on a test would make its score lie)
  dropped  already in a skill, or proposed for two skills (one sentence teaching two skills teaches neither)
  dropped  read by another skill's template (the template wins anyway; listed, as it may be a template's fault)
  dropped  for none: acted on by today's TermNL

Nothing to retrain since 25 Oct 2026 (ALIGN.md): the skills are read again when they load."""
